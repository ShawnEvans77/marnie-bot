API = application programming interface.

a way two pieces of software can communicate with one another.

[ SOFTWARE 1 ] -> [ SOFTWARE 2 ]

it allows different applications that aren't exactly the same to communicate. an api allows us to build functionality
in this application to make a request to another application. we have a server and then a client. 

instead of getting HTML, you will be getting javascript object orientation (JSON).

you may run into APIs that use XML, but most of them use JSON.

where we make the request, that is what we call an endpoint.

this REST thing stands for representational state transfer. this is the means of communications.

this 'REST' aspect is communicating over the web. 

we have some type of server software. 

we have a database, pieces of software would like to communicate with this database. we expose different API endpoints to this
software. 

we can do a GET request, get all the drinks or get a specific drink from my backend software. 


GET - retrieve data from the server
POST - post is used to write data. 
DELETE - used to delete stuff.
PUT - the difference between PUT and POST is a bit grey. PUT is used to update data, POST is used to write new data.

POST is used to add a resource, PUT is used to replace a resource.

PUT is said to be idempotent.
